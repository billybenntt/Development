The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.\n\n\n- This has to be applied to the child element no to the parent, this will center the child element.\n\n\n\n\n:::note note\n* In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element.\n* Center aligning has no effect if the width property is not set (or set to 100%).\n:::tip \n```css\ndiv.headline {\n  width: 400px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\n## Margin Collapse\n\n* Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together\n * Vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical margins sets the distance between adjacent elements\n\n![](image-kxpkjqto.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/ðŸ“˜ FrontEnd/CSS/Box Model","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-11-30T03:04:40.178Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-21T12:46:39.064Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"OjmrzS5tv"}
