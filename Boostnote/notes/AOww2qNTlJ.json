{"_id":"note:AOww2qNTlJ","title":"Conversation","content":"Sorry for not replying\n\nI was feeling emotional\n\nYou might have said how much you care for me a thousand times\n\nBut you still make me feel\n\nWhen things happen\n\nYou would just walk away and disappear\n\nI have learned not to believe in words\n\nBut actions\n\nI have not dissapeared\n\n\nBut you were ready to just slowly fade away\n\nI could feel it\n\nIt’s the same thing\n\nwhat made you feel that\n\n\nIt just makes me sad that you still think I am the person I was\n\n\nforgive me if you felt the slightest feeling that I was leaving, I am human after all, I fear of losing you too, for what is worth, there are no conditions for you to be in my life, no ifs, or buts, the moment you returned to my life I accepted everything as it is, and the same caring me shall remain even if you don't see it that way.\n\n\nI know these are words, but I think I have proven enough of my actions to justify my change\n\n\nI am not mad or upset, nor I have lost my composure despite everything going on in my life, I just want to ask you to understand me as a human being that is trying to change for the best\n\n\nMy thinking behind all this is rational rather than emotional, what kind of cruel selfish person would I be if I was against you trying to normalize and saving your relationship and living in a place where you feel at peace, I recognize that pursuing things my own gain will not set the example of person I want you to remember me for, I understand my own position in your life, even if we're never together I am already grateful you allowed me to be part of your life, don't worry about me in any way, I always find comfort and resiliency on the lessons of life, please recognize that I don't have any bad feelings about anything, and that I would not want to cause any suffering in your life, on the contrary I would always strive to be sweet towards you as you have been for me.\n\n\nI may be the selfish one\n\nRefuse to lose you\n\nBut not able to give what you want the most\n\nYou’re a wonderful person\n\nYou have always been\n\nit was just my fear talking\n\nI don’t might fighting o\n\nOr spilling the truth\n\nI just can’t stand the indifference\n\nLike you’re still there\n\nBut with distance\n\nFor you it could be a self protect mechanism to keep distance\n\nAnd I’m just asking too much to still wanting all your sweetness\n\nI panicked when you said the dice had just rolled again\n\nI do think about what life it would be with you\n\nQuite often\n\nYou would be a perfect father that a child could ever ask for\n\nBut things might not work out\n\nIt’s easier to let things stay where they are now\n\nYou have every right to feel upset\n\nI should be the one that keeps distance\n\nSo you wouldn’t be hurt by me\n\nSleep well, Billy\n\nMy dear, I choose not to feel upset, angry or jealous because I also have the right and the willingness to remain calm even if things are not in my favor, I would have regretted my entire life if I hadn't confessed you my feelings, or not knowing that you exist, I am extremely lucky I get to talk to such a wonderful, sweet, smart and pure person like you, just like you I do imagine a life together, I hear our kids running around in my imagination and you smiling which fills my heart of joy, I remember that day I held your hand and walked over that bridge at night the first time we met, in spite on the little time we had together, all these precious thoughts and memories have made me realize how grateful I should be that you exist in my life, things that I would otherwise would not have had been able to share with anyone else, more than anyone I understand your current position, every aspect of it I know it, I am aware of it, I am aware of the fear that you have on what I could think of all these things, your hesitation, your silence, your mood, all of it I am aware of everything that affects you, and I want you to know that I understand you, there will never be judgments from me, because I am a rational person, if we had kids I wouldn't want them to see me discussing and getting upset with their mother over things that make perfect sense when they're carefully discussed, although imagining a life with you has always been one of my greatest wishes in life, I have learned to detach myself from desire, and be very grateful for what I already have, because the world is a chaotic and unpredictable place and we must learn to live with the fact that some things are outside of our control, and I will always choose freedom, happiness and peace for you, I refrain myself from telling you my true feelings because it's so hard to prove things when I'm not there with you, many things are easier said than done, just know that I am not afraid of the future, that when the dices keep rolling, I will remain always calm so please don't fear or ache for me, I have learned from my mistakes and hardships in these past 5 years, I am a survivor, I have learned to live, so when you say that you should distance yourself from me to avoid hurting me, that's is not correct, please my sweet Juanita, stay, I'm asking you to stay, don't go, you'll always have a house in my heart, where you, Lucy and Mango can stay at anytime, like I said you have no restrictions to be in my life, I'm not indifferent to you, it's true that I protect myself by masking and concealing my emotions, because I'm the most vulnerable around you, as I have trusted you with many things that are important to me, I'm very careful with my words to you, because to me, you're a delicate soul and I should always be tender with you, forgive all the times I said things that have hurted you, thank you for reading what I have to say to you, sleep well my sweet Juanita.\n\n\nI just wish I could give you a hug\n\nThat would say more than a thousand words\n\nThe mere thought of it is already enough for me\n\n\nHave a nice day, Billy\n\nYou too Juanita\n\n\nSo where are we gonna meet\n\nHave you decided a location\n\nYou’re probably sleeping right now\n\nYou stayed up late last night\n\nSleep tight, Billy\n\nI was exercising\n\n\nWe'll meet in due time, right now I need you to settle well at your new place\n\n\nI don’t know when I will be settling\n\nJust tell me what you have learned planned\n\n\n\nLook what I've been doing\n\n\nI've been detoxing myself, eating just what's needed, avoiding sugar, showering with cold water in the mornings, hot at night\n\n\n1 hour of cardio\n\n\nAnd I've been practicing stoicism\n\n\nThat’s great\n\nYou’re taking care of yourself\n\nHow do you do that\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R9OCA6UFE-0\n\n\nReally comforting to have found this\n\n\nI need to practice too\n\nIf you don’t have a plan yet\n\nWe can plan together\n\nWe will, let me end my retreat first\n\n\nthere are many things I havent told you\n\n\nafter got back home\n\n\nI even cried\n\n\nAwww Billy\n\nhad to do something about it\n\n\nI didn’t mean to push you\n\nI needed that\n\n\nI just thought that when you said you were ready\n\nYou meant that\n\nI don't want to worry you much\n\n\nyou already have your own burdens\n\n\nI was actually worried about you\n\n\ni wanted to cheer you up the best way I could\n\n\nbut sort of backtracked on me\n\n\nI trust you are better now\n\n\nNot really\n\nI was hoping meeting you would be a mood changer\n\nSomething to look forward to\n\nYou will\n\n\nbut something tells me you need to calm the storm first\n\n\nWhen we meet, I'll introduce myself to you\n\n\njaja\n\n\nThere will not be a perfect time to meet\n\nYou cannot live under the storm forever\n\n\nThen I will introduce myself\n\nOut of courtesy\n\nIt’s the norm\n\nI'd be pleased to make acquantainces with you\n\n\njaja\n\n\nSo what have you planned\n\nOr you want to plan it together\n\nI'm shortlisting places\n\n\nbut I'd like to plan it with you\n\n\nWhat does the maddame has in

smarter and smarter\n\nThis definetly triggers my alarms xD\n\n\nJajajajaja maybe a little\n\nWith you\n\n\nI just don't have the heart to deny things to you\n\n\nI trust you a lot\n\n\nSo I'm really laid back with the stuff I tell you\n\n\nYou practically know most things about me\n\n\nYou said it yourself that there are many things you haven’t told me\n\nBy the way I saw the picture next to the

anyone\n\nThinking\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nListening\n\nI'm so ashamed of this but fine\n\n\nA very fat girl took my virginity\n\n\nWhen I was 16\n\n\nNone of my friends know that\n\n\nWas it mutually agreed ?\n\nShe asked me\n\n\nAnd I was afraid\n\n\nWas she older that you\n\nYes\n\n\nShe was 18\n\n\nI cried\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nAwww\n\nI’m so sorry\n\nI thought I've got her pregnant\n\n\nBut she was just messing with me\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nJajajajajajajaja\n\nOh I thought you felt raped or something\n\nYes that too\n\n\nReally ?\n\nThat’s awful\n\nIt was fast\n\n\nLike 5 minutes 😂😂\n\n\nDid it traumatize you somehow\n\nNopes\n\n\nThat’s a relief\n\nBut my other friends they all lost it with their girlfriends\n\n\nNah\n\nFirst time is overrated\n\nYes\n\n\nThank for telling me this\n\nIt means you’re comfortable with me knowing it\n\nI always feel I can tell you anything\n\n\nThat means a lot\n\nI’m not sure if I have secrets\n\nYou don't have to tell me\n\n\nNow\n\n\nLike I have things that I never told anyone\n\nBut it’s not like secrets\n\nI know you keep secrets, but there are things that should always remain inside your mind\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nJust me and my dark thoughts\n\nGrowing old\n\nJajaja I'm sure you'll be a sweet granny\n\n\nIf you can ask me a question that I have to give a honest answer\n\nWhat will you ank\n\nAsk\n\nI have a question\n\n\nYes\n\nWhat did you miss about me when I was gone\n\n\nThat question has been eating me away\n\n\nI remember there would be something going on\n\nAnd my first reaction was “I’m gonna tell Billy”\n\nThen the next second realizing I don’t have the right anymore\n\nYou were always there\n\nThank you for telling me that\n\n\nIt really means a lot\n\n\nLike a comfy place for me\n\nTo relax\n\nTo 任性\n\nI know, the same was for me\n\n\nAnd why was it eating you up ?\n\nI needed to understand why you wanted me to be back in your life\n\n\nI didn't quite left on good terms\n\n\nIt was an honest answer\n\nOkay\n\nTell me another secret\n\nAnd I’m off to bed\n\n😆\n\nMy second secret is no secret for you\n\n\nJajaja noooo\n\nIt's a riddle\n\n\nSolve it in your dream\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nLet

smart ?\n\nKind of unfair\n\nYour brain must be exhausted\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nOk\n\nAsk me a question\n\nOK\n\n\nThinking\n\n\nEven if you ask my weight\n\nI will be honest\n\nYou weight the same as a rabbit\n\n\nI don't need to ask that\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nA gigantic rabbit\n\nJajajajajaja\n\nA sweet rabbit\n\n\nIt's hard to ask you questions\n\n\nI usually figure things on my own xD\n\n\n\nStill a nice rabbit\n\n\nThat’s me as rabbit\n\nI'll be like the professor\n\n\nAnd ask\n\n\nWhat are you wearing\n\n\nThen you can go to sleep\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nI’m naked\n\nI see\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nJust kidding I’m wearing a white T-shirt\n\nThat’s it\n\nI get the same reaction as the professor\n\n\nHe gets sweaty and nervous\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nIt was lovely talking to you\n\n\nWait\n\nI thought you were going to bed\n\n\nThat couldn’t possibly be a question\n\nJajaja it was my question\n\n\nYes but I would like to have an ending\n\nOk\n\nLet me ask you a question\n\nOK\n\n\nI'm all ears\n\n\nWhat kind of porn do you like to watch\n\nTaiwanese\n\n\nNooooooo\n\nYeah\n\n\nNo kidding\n\n\nTaiwanese girls\n\n\nIs that a kind ?\n\nNothing else moves me\n\n\nJapanese is censored\n\n\nThai is a bit nasty\n\n\nKorean is similar to Japanese\n\n\nDon't like white girls\n\n\nTaiwanese is just elegant\n\n\nI don’t even know that exist\n\nI just know there’s asian\n\nLesbian\n\nJapanese\n\nI've been self restraining myself from porn lately\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nHow often did you watch\n\nBefore the retreat\n\n\nNow I’m curious what taiwanés porn looks like\n\nEvery day at night\n\n\nBefore shower\n\n\nNaughty Billy !\n\nJajajaja\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do\n\n\nSex is a human need\n\n\nTrue\n\nMen require post nut clarity\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nSaint mode\n\nNo men can make good choices withoit it\n\n\nIt's been affecting me lately\n\n\nBut I must resist the urge\n\n\nThe urge of watching porn?\n\nWell porn is just a tool\n\n\nMost times I can without porn\n\n\nWhat do you think when you do\n\nMental porn\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nSo do you prefer sex over touching yourself?\n\nOf course\n\n\nA thousand times\n\n\nHave you pictured yourself having sex with me ?\n\nI have\n\n\nTell me about it\n\nAlright\n\n\nI imagine you with black panties\n\n\nAnd I carefully remove them\n\n\nThen\n\n\nI start touching you\n\n\nAnd put you over me\n\n\nThe kissing starts\n\n\nAlways in a circular way\n\n\nThen I let you slowly fall into me and I go inside\n\n\nI imagine your smell\n\n\nThe steam of your mouth\n\n\nIt's quite intense\n\n\nThen you start jumping\n\n\nAnd you let me rub your breast with my tongue\n\n\nHaha\n\n\nAm I going to far\n\n\nJajaj\n\n\nI’m touching myself\n\nThen\n\n\nI turn around your body facing your back towards my chest\n\n\nAnd I start touching your clit\n\n\nYou tell me to stop but I continue either way\n\n\nWhile I kiss your neck and your right breast\n\n\nThen once the clit is completely wet\n\n\nI proceed to insert one finger\n\n\nWhich slowly turns around your vaginal lips\n\n\nOnce it's all completely wet\n\n\nTo the point you can't even stand\n\n\nI lower my mouth down there\n\n\nAnd I let my tongue in\n\n\nYou keep telling me to stop but you don't release my head\n\n\nSo I continue licking\n\n\nMy tongue keeps going to the very bottom while I also keep stimulating the clit\n\n\nAnd then suddenly you start feeling something coming\n\n\nYou are afraid of it because feels intense\n\n\nBut it finally arrives\n\n\nThen I go back and hug you\n\n\nAnd tell you how much I love you\n\n\nSorry If I went that far\n\n\nThere's usually a 10 minute break\n\n\nBefore the second round\n\n\nSounds like a very good sex\n\nHahaha\n\n\nThought you fell asleep on me\n\n\nYeah I would fall asleep during the break\n\nYeah I figured\n\n\nGood night Billy\n\nGood night Juanita\n\n\nSleep tight\n\n\nYou too\n\nI will, I really made you fall asleep\n\n\nIn a good way\n\nMorning Billy\n\nMorning Juanita\n\n\nHow was your sleep\n\nSueprinsingly pleasant, slept like a baby\n\n\nYou did wake up quite early though\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nGotta walk Lucy\n\nWas supposed to wake up earlier\n\nPoor girl Lucy she waited a long time jaja\n\n\nAre there any parks in 林口 around the place you're looking for to live\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nWe’re gonna go see the houses today\n\nNot sure yet\n\npretty sure there are, 林口 is similar to Tamsui in terms of real state\n\n\nThe rent is high\n\nI don’t know if I can afford it\n\nIt’s bee stressing me out\n\nI thought about moving back with my parents\n\nTo save money\n\nBut living with my mom is another challenge\n\nPlus mango is really hard to deal with\n\nThe noise\n\nThe chewing\n\nI feel like they would find a way to bully him the moment I step up of the door\n\nHuman don’t usually see from other creatures’ perspective\n\nThey don’t try to understand why they do certain things\n\nThey would just use violence to stop bad behaviors\n\nI have imagined things at your parents home would not be ideal\n\n\nbut I'm sure Felix can bear the side of the financial burden considering state of things\n\n\nI know things will get better\n\n\nI am so sorry you are going through all this, but I truly trust and hope that things will go back as they were\n\n\nthank you, billy\n\nI hope you had a good day Juanita\n\n\n😊\n\nI can’t wait to read the book\n\nJajaja I can't wait to surprise you with it\n\n\n😂😂\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nAt least you'll be happy with it 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot pot!\n\nCan’t believe I wasn’t invited\n\nYou're my special guest,

grandparents til 7\n\nAw Juanita, I would love to see that place then\n\n\nI saw a picture of you the other day\n\n\nThere’s a park near the house that I used to play in with my cousins\n\nWith the

food\n\nJajaja\n\n\nHer treats\n\nIf I had a pet I'd do the same\n\n\nTreats toys\n\n\nHer meds\n\nI'd be a good dog dad\n\n\nI believe you would be\n\nI'm full of love to pets\n\n\nHow sweet\n\nThey are like kids\n\n\nDad was the same\n\n\nHe always would carry the dogs like babies xD\n\n\nAww\n\nAnd talk to them stories haha\n\n\nMy sister and I used to laugh\n\n\nWhat a great father\n\nSo\n\nHe was\n\n\nI wonder if you recognize me tomorrow\n\nWith mask\n\nOf course I will\n\n\nOk\n\nI have forgotten a few things though\n\n\nThen I will wait for you to come say hi\n\nLike ?\n\nYour expressions\n\n\nYour voice\n\n\nIt makes me sad not to remember those things\n\n\nHope you will find those back tomorrow\n\nAfter these years\n\nThat'd be my gift\n\n\nWe talked for first time ever in March 2016\n\n\nI can also give you a big hug\n\nYou matched me because you saw that I wrote 嘿啊\n\n\nOn my profile\n\n\nI first hugged you at the zoo mrt\n\n\nEverytime I pass by that place I remember that exact moment\n\n\n😂\n\nWhat was your first impression of me\n\nShe's so pretty\n\n\nJajajajajaja\n\nJajaja\n\n\nYes\n\n\nI saw you and in my mind I hear a voice she's so pretty haha\n\n\nJajajajajajajajaja\n\nBut what I really liked about you\n\n\nIt was your personality\n\n\nI always feel that my pictures look better\n\nThe way you think about stuff and you just know it\n\n\nLike yesterday with the book\n\n\nI was being a bummer\n\nJajaja\n\nRuined the surprise\n\nBut I love the fact that you just knew how to know it was the book\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nI will take it down a notch\n\nNo one like know it all\n\nNope\n\n\nI won't allow it haha\n\n\nIt’s funny\n\nCause when we first met\n\nYou just seemed like you only wanted to be friend\n\nJajaja\n\nTruth is that I was unsure of not staying in Taiwan\n\n\nAt that time the government would only give you less than 3 months to find a job\n\n\nI fell for you in hindsight\n\n\nThen distance built up\n\n\nThings got harder\n\n\nIt’s also funny that\n\nYou’re into Taiwanese girls\n\nJajaja\n\n\nNothing wrong with that\n\n\nBut tomorrow I guess you will understand things better\n\n\nI’m told often that I’m different from most of the Taiwanese girls\n\nYou're one in a kind\n\n\nThere are no two of you\n\n\nJajajaja just like everyone\n\nNopes\n\n\nGoing back home now\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nI didn’t know you were outside\n\nI was\n\n\nI was at my friend's Pablo house\n\n\nAnd my other friend and his girlfriend\n\n\nI would've been nice to have you join\n\n\nHow would you introduce me?\n\nThey already know my crush\n\n\nSo I would only need to call you by your name\n\n\nAnd they would say ahh\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nJajajajaja\n\nJajajaja\n\n\nThe notorious Cecilia\n\n可可\n\n\nTo increase cuteness of naming\n\n\nDid they see that you were texting instead of focusing on them ?\n\nYes, my friends girlfriend noticed\n\n\n在微笑啦\n\n\n跟妳聊天的時侯真的好明顯\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nIf they asked\n\n我臉的表情好白癡\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nWould you show them the messages ?\n\nThose are private\n\n\nIn a cute way I believe\n\nJaja I believe\n\n\nEveryone notices\n\n\nIs it a bad thing lol\n\n\nThanks for making me famous\n\nIn a cute way\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nSo what time are you meeting your friends tomorrow?\n\nThey always ask me when I'm going to bring someone to our gatherings\n\n\nI’ll leave you alone\n\nI'm meeting my other friends at night\n\n\nAround 9 pm\n\n\nYou just ended a relationship\n\nYes that's why they ask\n\n\nSo late !\n\nYou’re gonna take a day off on Monday ?\n\nI'll take a few hours off\n\n\nWhat did you replay\n\nI reply with a smile\n\n\nAnd do my habitual change of topic\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nThat’s you\n\nThat's me\n\n\nThey must miss your ex\n\nThey only met Kathy once\n\n\nOnce?\n\nKathy was quite shy\n\n\nAround my friends\n\n\nBut when she took me to meet her friends\n\n\nShe wasn't shy at all\n\n\nJajaja then were you shy ?\n\nNot at all\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nI was shy with her family though\n\n\nThey said I was too 客氣\n\n\n😂\n\nYou were probably being respectful\n\nAnd decent\n\nYes I was, I am always around family members\n\n\nWith friends I'm casual\n\n\nI believe\n\nI wonder what would your family be like with a guy like me\n\n\nSo respectful\n\n\nAnd shy\n\n\nTo ask questions\n\n\nYou can find out yourself someday\n\nAnd just eat little portions of food at the table because I don't want to give the impression that I eat a lot\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nOhhh\n\nThey wouldn’t accept that\n\nThey would assume you don’t like the food\n\n😂😂\n\n\nPlus I devour when having meals with my family\n\nI would behave then\n\n\nI can’t be the only one that eats a lot\n\nWhat if I'm asked hard questions\n\n\nLike\n\n\nLike how did you lose your virginity?\n\nHow many girlfriends I had\n\n\nOh jajajaja\n\nOr that\n\n\nSurprise them\n\nCan I smile and change the topic\n\n\nBut I don’t think they would ask that\n\nOr pretend I'm choking with the food\n\n\nJajajaja\n\n\nYou can do that too\n\nNice\n\n\nWould your friends ask me hard questions ?\n\nThey are not allowed to\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nJajajajajaja\n\nLike you would warn them in advance or something\n\nIt'd be nice if you can be friends with her girlfriends\n\n\nI always have imagined you talking with them\n\n\nJajaja\n\nThey know I have a bad record ghosting girls\n\n\nI warned them not to bring that up\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nJajajajajaja\n\nOther than that it's cool\n\n\nWhat if they asked why aren’t we dating\n\nThat's hard to reply haha\n\n\nSo we just smile and change the topic\n\n\nI would say cause Billy is so picky\n\nI'm not picky with you!\n\n\nAnd has bad history of ghosting girls\n\nJajajaja\n\nCase in point, you're not the victim there\n\n\nI haven’t been told not to bring that up!\n\nTotally entitled to make fun of that\n\nWould you please stop 😂😂\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nSee\n\nThey would love me for that\n\nThey would see how vulnerable you are with me\n\nJajajajajaja\n\n\nI will bury my head on the sand\n\n\nJajaja\n\nYour parents would be probably the hardest part\n\n\nNot really\n\nThey would see my Chinese isn't that horrible\n\n\nMy grandparents from my mother’s side are the headrest part\n\nI'll get asked level 10 questions\n\n\nGrandparents are not difficult\n\n\nThey would just ask basic questions\n\nLike where you from\n\nI would reply in basic 台語\n\n\nWhat you do\n\nWin their hearts\n\n\nThey don’t speak Taiwanese\n\nEven better\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nIsn't like I'm a kid that just graduated high school\n\n\nThe ones that on my father’s side\n\nDo\n\nI think I can survive that part\n\n\nGood\n\nOkay\n\nAnd the cookies\n\n\nI gotta go to bed\n\nTell me a secret\n\nI already know I have to bring cookies\n\n\nWhy cookies )\n\nOr 鳳梨酥\n\n\nThat's like the visitation offer\n\n\nWhat other secret would you like to know\n\n\nPick a category\n\n\nYour dark side\n\nI have hacked people\n\n\nThat’s just funny\n\nNot dark\n\nAnd cool\n\nI literally broken marriages\n\n\n?\n\nThere was one guy that had a wife\n\n\nAnd he was commenting on a girl's account, sort of harassing her\n\n\nI resetted his password using phishing\n\n\nGrabbed and screenshotd everything on his social media\n\n\nAnd sent him to his wife\n\n\nDo you know them personally ?\n\nI know the girl that he was harrasing\n\n\nYou brought justice\n\nNot dark at all\n\nPretty encouraging jajaja\n\nJajaja thanks for seeing it like that\n\n\nDark stuff\n\n\nI've tried Marijuana in Thailand\n\n\nBut at the end\n\n\nIt wasn't Marijuana\n\n\nSo it doesn't really count\n\n\nI have weed sitting in my drawer now\n\nI've changed my grades a few times while in nccu\n\n\nA gift from a friend\n\nJajajaja maybe one day we could finish it\n\n\nNever really had real weed\n\n\nYou should have done it for me\n\nI had it a few times\n\nI know\n\n\nQuite envy you\n\n\nBut not a fan\n\nThe smell is repelling\n\nI had shrooms once\n\n\nNot sure how different would be from weed\n\n\nI like to smoke shisha with weed\n\nI think it’s a lot stronger than weed\n\nCan't wait to see you high\n\n\nJajaja\n\nOr drunk\n\n\nI just laught a lot\n\nSame\n\n\nEverything is so funny when I’m drunk\n\nBut I'll always care of you\n\n\nWhen you're drunk\n\n\nEven if I'm puked\n\n\nYou still haven’t said a dark secret\n\n😂\n\nNot sure what counts as dark these days\n\n\nI haven't killed anyone\n\n\nOr treated anyone badly\n\n\nI know how to do bad stuff\n\n\nRuin someone's life\n\n\nBut don't really feel like doing it\n\n\nYou must have a dark secret\n\n\nI want to know it\n\n\nMy dark secret ?\n\nWhat is it\n\n\nWhere are the bodies\n\n\nLet me think\n\nThink or decide whether you want to tell me\n\n\nOkay\n\nI have stolen\n\nThat's not a dark secret\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nOnce in my life\n\nI was 10\n\nDoesn't count\n\n\nAnd I couldn’t finish memorizing the book\n\nI have stolen too\n\n\nSo I stole teacher’s stamp\n\nBut that's not a dark secret\n\n\nJajaja\n\n\nI really felt ashamed of myself for so long\n\nJajajajaja\n\nI have never told a soul !\n\nJaja I would have done the same\n\n\nYou can pick a category\n\nNothing compared to what some of my friends have done\n\n\nGive me a direction\n\nYour turn\n\n\nGive me a category\n\n\nThat'd just give me a better idea\n\n\nOf what a dark secret should be\n\n\nSex\n\n我就知道\n\n\n哈哈\n\n\nPeople usually have wild sex secrets\n\nJajaja\n\n\nYes\n\n\n1000 points to Billy\n\nThere's stuff there\n\n\nOn my 18th birthday my friends took me to a strip club\n\n\nMy friends got me 3 strippers for myself\n\n\nJust to touch\n\n\nNo sex involved\n\n\nThat’s it ?\n\nOne more\n\n\nI have been bitten in my left egg\n\n\nIt happened in Thailand in 2014\n\n\nWouldn’t it hurt so bad ?\n\nYes\n\n\nIt hurted\n\n\nWhat happened\n\nGirl was drunk\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nI have no idea who that girl was\n\n\nYou were given an oral ?\n\nIt seemed like it was\n\n\nBut it just wasn't\n\n\nJajajaja\n\nDid you get mad\n\nWhen you're in pain like that\n\n\nYou forget you're mad\n\n\nPoor Billy\n\nWhat if I have become sterile\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nBut that experience has made me afraid of orals\n\n\nYou’ve got another one\n\nTrue\n\n\nEither way not a fan of oral sex\n\n\nFor me\n\n\nI hope that has answered your question\n\n\nIt was interesting\n\nJajaja\n\n\nMy turn ?\n\nI'm more curious about what you like\n\n\nArousallly speaking\n\n\nWhat makes you moan\n\n\nNaughty Billy\n\nSorry\n\n\nThat's the demon speaking\n\n\nYou can ignore him\n\n\nJaja\n\n\nLong foreplay\n\nBeing dominated\n\n:))\n\n\nBeing loved\n\nThat's something I would like to be part of, that affection\n\n\nOh and sex talk\n\nI love to press the skin\n\n\nThat squeeze\n\n\nEveryone has a different signature\n\n\nMine is always a process\n\n\nBut different every time\n\n\nI like to get creative\n\n\nAnd of course, cuddling at the end\n\n\nThat's always a must\n\n\nI like to be conquered\n\nI love that word\n\n\nConquest\n\n\nI don't like to being told\n\n\nBut to be left on doubt to figure out for myself\n\n\nMakes that idea more exciting\n\n\nLike making yourself very difficult\n\n\nHow do you picture me in bed\n\nWha am I like\n\nI have a thing for black underwear\n\n\nEverytime I imagine you\n\n\nYou always have black underwear\n\n\nJajaja\n\nYour nipples are white\n\n\nNot so dark\n\n\nI used to own only black underwear\n\nNot huge\n\n\nBut not small\n\n\nJust the right size\n\n\nSoft skin\n\n\nYou mean pink?\n\nSort of\n\n\nI imagine down there\n\n\nHairy\n\n\nBut not a lot\n\n\nIn the inside soft\n\n\nWarm\n\n\nJust the right tightness\n\n\nA nice belly\n\n\nMe going down that belly\n\n\nBreathing it kissing it\n\n\nYour hair is always tied up\n\n\nBecause it is gets in the way I kiss you\n\n\n\nThis was taken in 2017\n\nYou can tell by the phone\n\nI used to own just black underwears\n\nBut now I don’t have any\n\nThat's exactly how I pictured everything\n\n\nEvery detail\n\n\nGod\n\n\nMy blood is flowing like crazy now\n\n\nJajaja it was taken almost 6 years ago\n\nFeels like a deja vu to me\n\n\nLike I seen every bit of that body\n\n\nYour imagination is not completely correct\n\nMy nipples are not white\n\nHaha\n\n\nI imagine them pinkish\n\n\nBrownie\n\n\nBut not completely dark\n\n\nLet me check\n\nJaajaja\n\n\nThey’re shy\n\nMaybe the other day\n\nI'm wondering if I'm dreaming right now\n\n\nI’m not the same as you have imagined\n\nYou can't see what's in my head\n\n\nI used to dream of you\n\n\nThe first time\n\n\nI woke up with a wet surprise\n\n\nYou can count that as one of my secrets\n\n\nAre you gonna touch yourself looking at my picture\n\nAlready happening\n\n\nYou’re welcome\n\nHappy birthday\n\nI will never forget this gift\n\n\nI just wish I could have you here with me\n\n\nGiving you everything I've been holding back all these years\n\n\nLoving you, kissing you, listening you, making love with you\n\n\nConquering you\n\n\nMaybe one day\n\nI have never abandoned the fight\n\n\nThat inner part of me refuses to give up on you\n\n\nDespite everything I've gained, none of anything has brought me the fulfillment I need\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nWithout you, I think I would've never gotten this far\n\n\nI can’t possibly take the credits\n\nYou're the treasure\n\n\nEven if I'm told it's imposible to find, or I'm told I would fail, I just do it anyway\n\n\nBecause I feel alive doing it\n\n\nGood night Juanita\n\n\nSee you
