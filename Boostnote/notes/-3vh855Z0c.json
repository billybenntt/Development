Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. \n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n  - [Screenshot](#screenshot)\n  - [Links](#links)\n- [My process](#my-process)\n  - [Built with](#built-with)\n  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)\n  - [Continued development](#continued-development)\n  - [Useful resources](#useful-resources)\n- [Author](#author)\n- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n\n**Note: Delete this note and update the table of contents based on what sections you keep.**\n\n## Overview\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![](./screenshot.jpg)\n\nAdd a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select \"Take a Screenshot\". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. \n\nThen crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.\n\n**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**\n\n### Links\n\n- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)\n- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)\n\n## My process\n\n### Built with\n\n- Semantic HTML5 markup\n- CSS custom properties\n- Flexbox\n- CSS Grid\n- Mobile-first workflow\n- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework\n- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles\n\n**Note: These are just examples.
