This educated guess is known as a hypothesis and helps to determine the data you need to collect.\n- \nWe should try to disprove our hypotheses, we try and show that weâ€™re really, really confident that itâ€™s not false.\n\n\n1. Determine what data could disprove our hypothesis\n2. Determine how much data to collect (the larger the sample size and the more diverse your dataset is, the more confident youâ€™ll be in your results)\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image-kxrb6e7a.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/ðŸ“™ Data Science/Data Science Process","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-12-30T02:35:08.407Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T05:41:44.766Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"6-DI1mzmm"}
