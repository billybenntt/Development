# Media Queries

### Common Sizes

- 320px — 480px: Mobile devices

- 481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets

- 769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops

- 1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens

### Max Width

Queries with max width, will apply styles **<mark>UP TO</mark>** that size not beyond

### Min Width

Queries with min width, will apply styles <mark>**STARTING FROM**</mark> that size.

### Mobile First

We start off by designing the styles for smallest screens (on the default area) and we start adding changes / overriding values (on media queries)
