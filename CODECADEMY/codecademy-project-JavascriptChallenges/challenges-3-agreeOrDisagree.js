// Write your function here:


const agreeOrDisagree = (word1, word2) => {
    return word1 === word2 ? 'You agree!' : 'You disagree!';
}


// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep"))
// Should print 'You agree!'

// We encourage you to add more function call of your own to test your code!
