# CSS Introduction

#### Specificity

Specificity takes precedence in the following manner

Inline styles > Internal CSS > External CSS

#### Last Rule Principle

If there are two rules that target the same element, the last rule will take priority.

#### External Resources

All external resources imported into the HTML file should always be included before the CSS `link` tag, some external resources use inline styles.
